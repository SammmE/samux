A barebones, `no_std` operating system kernel written from scratch in Rust, primarily for educational purposes.

## 🦀 Why FerrOS?

This project is a journey into the world of low-level systems programming. The primary goals are:

* To learn the fundamentals of operating system design and implementation.
* To explore the power of Rust for writing safe and efficient systems-level code.
* To understand hardware interaction, memory management, and process scheduling from the ground up.
* To have fun building something challenging and rewarding!

## 🛠️ Building and Running

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following tools to build and run FerrOS:

* **Rust (nightly):** `rustup override set nightly` in the project directory.
* **QEMU:** An emulator to run the OS (e.g., `qemu-system-x86_64`).
* **cargo-bootimage:** `cargo install bootimage`

### Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<YOUR_USERNAME>/ferros.git
    cd ferros
    ```
2.  **Build and run:**
    The simplest way is to use `cargo bootimage`, which will build the kernel and create a bootable disk image.

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

    *(Note: This requires a `.cargo/config.toml` file to be set up to use QEMU as the runner. If not, you can run manually after building.)*

    **Manual Run:**
    ```sh
    # Build the bootable image
    cargo bootimage

    # Run with QEMU
    qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=target/x86_64-ferros/debug/bootimage-ferros.bin
    ```

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

This is the high-level plan for FerrOS, from a "Hello, World!" kernel to a basic interactive system.

### Phase 1: The Core Kernel & Bootstrapping
* [ ] **Project Setup:** Create a `no_std` Rust binary.
* [ ] **Bootloader:** Integrate the `bootimage` crate to create a bootable image.
* [ ] **VGA Text Mode Driver:** Implement a basic logger to print formatted text to the screen.
* [ ] **Panic Handler:** Implement a kernel panic function that prints info and halts.

### Phase 2: Interrupts & Memory Management
* [ ] **GDT (Global Descriptor Table):** Set up a basic GDT.
* [ ] **IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table):** Implement an IDT to handle CPU exceptions (e.g., page faults, double faults).
* [ ] **Paging (Paging V4):** Implement a virtual memory manager, including mapping the kernel and setting up page tables.
* [ ] **Heap Allocator:** Provide a global allocator (like `linked_list_allocator`) to enable using `alloc` (e.g., `Box`, `Vec`).
* [ ] **Physical Frame Allocator:** Create an allocator to manage physical memory frames (e.g., a simple bitmap or free list).

### Phase 3: Hardware & Concurrency
* [ ] **PIC/APIC:** Handle hardware interrupts from the PIC (or APIC).
* [ ] **PIT (Programmable Interval Timer):** Set up the timer for scheduling.
* [ ] **PS/2 Keyboard Driver:** Read scancodes from the keyboard and translate them to characters.
* [ ] **Preemptive Multitasking:** Implement basic task switching and a simple scheduler.

### Phase 4: Userspace & Filesystems
* [ ] **Syscalls:** Design and implement a basic syscall interface.
* [ ] **Userspace:** Create the ability to load and run a simple program in user mode.
* [ ] **Basic Filesystem:** Implement a RAM-based filesystem (initrd) to load initial user programs.
* [ ] **Basic Shell:** Create a minimal interactive shell to test keyboard input and run commands.
